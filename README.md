# Smoking Detector

Smoking detector software for a project course in the third year of the electrical engineering program at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola.

The goal of this project is to detect a lit cigarette, in areas where one cannot have cameras, using passive infrared sensors.

At the moment of writing the software consists of a TCP server, responsible for accepting and transmitting sensor data, and a TCP client responsible for data manipulation and visualization.
